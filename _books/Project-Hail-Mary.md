This book was a great read and delivered a feel good ending without it feeling unearned which is my main gripe with stories like these. Weir does a great job of writing engineering and science jargon in a way that is not head splitting for me to read as an engineer. I also really like that the multiple alien physiologys described in the book feel plausible yet in-human.<br/><br/> My main issue with this book is the humor. It just feels dated to me at this point. I'll admit that it feels genuine coming from Weir but this kind of theatrical sarcasm has been done again and again in the time since the Martian was published to the point where it feels a bit... tired. It wasn't so distracting that I couldn't enjoy the book but I pulled me out of it occasionally.
