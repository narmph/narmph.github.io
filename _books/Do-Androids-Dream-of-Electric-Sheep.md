I think PKDs work falls into a category of science fiction of its own. While the plots are defiantly interesting I think what he does best is examining the human condition. Rick Deckard is not a good person but he is a very interesting one. He is not surrounded by good people but interesting ones. He goes through this book slowly unraveling the cultural conditioning that allowed him to become a murderer in world where even spiders are considered precious life forms. He sees a man so overcome by his hatred for androids that he is willing to die at the thought of being one and it shakes him. While he doesn't end the book seeing the full humanity in androids and synthetic beings, he does allow himself to find them precious nonetheless. I have found the works of PKD's that I have read quite though provoking and I will definitely be reading more.
