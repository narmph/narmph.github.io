I'm not going to give this book an official rating since I didn't finish it but my unofficial rating is a 2/5. How Tade Thompson managed to take such an interesting an fun premise and make it so boring is a wonder for sure. I have two main criticisms, the first is that Kaaro, the main character, is just so unlikable. I get writing a flawed or even down right bad person as your protagonist but this was just done in such an uninteresting way. In one chapter, he finds out that he got is girlfriend violently killed by a mob and doesn't seem to care all that much and he doesn't seem at all affected by it for the rest of the movie. He's also petty, he psychically tortures a guy for no other reason than he vaguely reminds him of his old grade school bully. And he's a coward, at multiple points in the book when conflict arises, he runs off not caring in the slightest what will happen to the people he was with (which is incidentally how his girlfriend gets killed). Point being, the guy sucks but I don't get the feeling he was supposed to come off that way. He's not unlikable in a compelling way, he's unlikable in a way that makes me want to stop reading because has done nothing to make me care about what happens to him, good or bad. The other issue I had with it was that the plot was just boring. I think skipping back and forth from the main timeline and the past so we get Kaaros back story was not a good narrative choice or at the very least no executed well. I got nearly half way through the book and the plot has just now barely started because we've spent so much time on frankly useless back story. If you're going to make a character driven story, at least make the character interesting. Anyway, I'm giving up on this one.
