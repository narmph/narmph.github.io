I don't have a ton to say about this one. It's length and short chapters make it an easy read. What I would say about this book is that it doesn't have anything to say that you haven't already heard from somewhere else. It's not a bad message by any means, it's just not a very unique one. That being said, I think the message was delivered beautifully and I found myself feeling a bit emotional at times while reading it. I think a more interesting ending would have been if <spoiler> the Book of Regrets went blank except for one new regret that appears: "I regret killing myself". Then she chooses to live in the life where everything is the same except she didn't kill herself and it sticks this time. </spoiler> I guess that's what I expected to happen anyway. At the end of the day, it's an easy read with a positive and easily digestible message. I'm glad I read it but I probably wont be revisiting it.
