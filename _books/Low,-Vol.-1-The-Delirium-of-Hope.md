I loved the artwork in this book. It’s what drew me to it in the first place. My main issue with this book is its depiction of women. It knocks it from a solid four to a soft three for me. Despite the women in this story being the most interesting characters, they are also the most objectified by the art. Don’t get me wrong, I love hot women but even hot women wear cloths sometimes. Just let the mom have some cargo pants or something I don’t know. It’s honestly just lazy character design at this point.
