This book was very good for what it was, an easy-to-ready YA mystery romance. My main issues with it come from the fact that I am not the target audience for this book. The mysteries felt incredibly gimmicky and I had trouble suspending disbelief. The characters also didn’t feel real. They seemed to only act in ways that served a purpose in the story. Anyway… it was fine. I’m not gonna read the second one but I was entertained by this one.
