Overall great read. It was a bit slow at the start but once I got into it the book flew. I like when authors show characters being smart instead of telling the reader they're smart. The story also wraps up nicely while leaving room for a sequel so I can be satisfied while knowing the next book is there it I want it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by the books use of female characters. I was originally apprehensive because of the objectifying prose in the first half of the book but in the second half of the book it became clear that was as a result of the immaturity of the point of view characters. Not to say that it's totally perfect but I can see what the author was going for even if I wish it was done a bit better.
