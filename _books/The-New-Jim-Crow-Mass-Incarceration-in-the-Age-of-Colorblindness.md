Well written and well researched; this book opens the door to discussing race in the United States. Like Alexander says in the first chapter, this book is for people who already know there are systematic racial injustices but do not know the specifics. In a country so resistant to admitting deep seeded racism still exists, it is important for those who know the truth to understand the facts in order to undermine ignorance.
