            Work was undertaken to make upgrades to the Crystalize experiment. The scope of this project was the design and verification of several physical components for the TPC assembly, including a molded PTFE test piece and a heatsink. All CAD and work was completed in Solidworks. A PTFE test piece was created using a 304 stainless steel mold, capable of withstanding the 4500 psi necessary to form PTFE (Teflon). The mold, assumed in three pieces, was validated using pressure load simulations. The second component designed was a copper and aluminum heatsink, designed to prevent room temperature Kapton cables from melting or boiling off the xenon held in the main assembly.
