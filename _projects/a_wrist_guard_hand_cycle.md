        This project aimed to alleviate wrist pain for a user who regularly used their handcycle and saw it as their main source of exercise and connection with community. The goal was to create an attachment to their bike that would change some of the loading due to cycling from the wrists to the upper arms. It was also imparitive to create something that would not alter the bike itself and was inexpensive and easy to manufacture.
