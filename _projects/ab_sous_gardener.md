        <p>A small flowerpot with an embedded moisture sensor and NFC tag. When you tap the flowerpot with your phone it takes you to a webpage with live readouts from the moisture sensor and tells you if you need to water your plant. We used <a href= 'https://micropython.org'>micropython</a> with an <a href= 'https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/overview'>ESP32 microcontroller</a> and <a href= 'https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stemma-soil-sensor-i2c-capacitive-moisture-sensor/overview'>I2C capacitive moisture sensor</a></p>.

        <p>An upgrade to the sous gardener to also track light levels and actuate a pump or a grow-light when the soil is too dry or the plant isnâ€™t getting enough light. All with a new GUI in Labview that allows you to manually toggle the grow-light and pump and track light moisture levels in real time. This project was initially supposed to be a group project but due to drops and low attendance I ended up doing it entirely on my own. I only ended up being able to build the hardware components and the GUI and didn't get to integrate it into a planter like I wanted to. </p>.
