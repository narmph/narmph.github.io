I checked out of the whole Marvel thing after Infinity War but a dear friend of mine swore by it so I went and saw it the theater him. Although I'm not really back on the Marvel hypetrain, I did really enjoy this movie. The story was the right scale for an actual movie while tying in pretty nicely with the larger universe. I always love [Florence Pugh](https://letterboxd.com/actor/florence-pugh/) so her center stage role in this movie was a big part of my enjoyment. I also really liked how mature the movie was in handling some pretty dark subject matter, especially considering it's a Marvel movie. Overall, a fun watch with a good performances, fun characters, and a great score (apparently the same team that did the score for [Everything, Everywhere, All At Once](https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/) according to letterboxd).
